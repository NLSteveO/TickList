# TickList

This is a web application to act as a online tick list for rock climbers where they can add and edit rock climbing routes and problems from within the application.

## Usage

At the moment I am restarting this project so there is no usage. I will update this section as I get the project going again.

## Install

First clone the project from the repository or download the project zip, and then from the projects root directory run:

```
$ npm install
```

## Run

To run this node server just run:
```
$ npm start
```

## In this version (v2.0.0)

I'm starting over, it's been 7 years since i worked on this project and i have learned a lot since then. I plan on using some newer tools and libraries to build this project.

## Next steps

- [x]: Clear out the old to make room for the new.
- [ ]: Scaffold my new vite project.
- [ ]: Get it deploying to GitHub pages.
- ...

## Technologies

Will add them as i decide on them.

## Acknowledgments

TickList was inspired by my love of rock climbing and although there already exists tick lists for rock climbing, I wanted to create my own to build a web app project based on something I love and will probably even use once it is built.
