# TickList

This is a web application to act as a online tick list for rock climbers where they can add and edit rock climbing routes and problems from within the application.

## Usage

At the moment this API is designed to be used with POSTMAN to make requests and get responses from the API.

## Install

First clone the project from the repository or download the project zip, and then from the projects root directory run:

```
$ npm install
```

## Run

To run this node server just run:
```
$ npm start
```

## In this version (v0.0.0)

I have completed the tutorial on Scotch.io and created a small RESTful API that i have interacted with using POSTMAN.

## Plans for the next iteration

In the next iteration of this project I plan to add more models for the data base and new routes.

## Technologies

- Node JS
- Express JS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose JS

## Acknowledgments

TickList was inspired by my love of rock climbing and although there already exists tick lists for rock climbing, I wanted to create my own to build a web app project based on something I love and will probably even use once it is built. That being said I would like to acknowledge [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io) for their tutorial on [building a RESTful API with Node and Express 4](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4) as i chose this for my starting point and built up from there.
